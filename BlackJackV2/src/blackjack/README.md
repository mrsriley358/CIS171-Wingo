# Week12 Exam: Final Project

Create a program in which a user plays a simple version of the card game 21 
against the computer. The computer will run a network server 
process allowing client players to connect. Each player is initially dealt 
two cards from a standard deck of 52. Random numbers will represent the 
cards from 1 to 10. After seeing their hand the user then the 
house (computer) are given the opportunity to take additional 
cards (hit me). The hand that comes the closest to 21 without 
exceeding 21 wins the game. A draw results if both players have 
the same score.
