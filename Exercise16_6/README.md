## Analysis Steps

The Asiignment was: Write a program that sets the horizontal alignment and column-size properties of a text field dynamically.
I spent a couple of hourse flipping throught previous chapter and made sure I had a grasp Listeners and Lambdas. I then watched the videos in the chapter and started to understand a bit more what the assignment was asking from me.

### Design

THe design and organization of the project closely mirrors lessons taught through the video lessons. This is because I couldn't think of an easier way to organize the code.

### Testing

I first wanted to get the toggle function in the radio buttons to work, they were a bit buggy, but It was just syntactical errors.
The second Challenge was to figure out the syntax for the parser in the setPrefColumnCount property. The rest was pretty straight forward.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
