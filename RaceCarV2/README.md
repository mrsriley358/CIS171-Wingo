![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

I first watched the moving fan code to get a basis of animation in javafx
then I made the car polygon to fit the requirements
I then made a basic program to just display the car.
I then began to mess around with function that move the car without looping mechanisms
then I began to form looping mechanisms and way to implement them.
### Design

Only used one external class, didn't see the need to have any more than 1.

```
I used an external class/methods to do all of the animation movement calculations.
```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
